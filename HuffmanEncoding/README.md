# Huffman Encoding

This project demonstrates an understanding of Huffman encoding and decoding using priority queues, heaps, and file reading/writing to compress large files.

To run this code, simply run Compression.java by picking an input file in the main method. Currently inputs/WarAndPeace.txt is set.
