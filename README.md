# About Me:
I’m a senior at Dartmouth College pursuing a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science, with a strong interest in software development, quantitative finance, and algorithmic trading. I’ve applied these skills through internships in software engineering, investment management, and private equity, and am particularly excited by roles that bridge technical depth with financial impact.
