# About Me:
My name is Jake Fleming, and I am a computer science and mathematics double major at Dartmouth College graduating in 2026. I am currently employed as a teaching assistant for object-oriented programming, and I know languages such as Python and Java. I've studied artificial intelligence, algorithms, security, and more, and have experience with visual basic from an internship in private equity. This repository displays several of the projects I have coded or collaborated on.
