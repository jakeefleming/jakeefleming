# How to run code

To run this assignment, simply run solve_sudoku.py. You can change between the differnt cnf files just by changing the string in puzzle_name. You can change walk_sat to gsat if desired. Also uncomment simulated_annealing line if wanting to test that. I recommend running simulated_annealing and gsat on "rows.cnf" and running walk_sat on "puzzle1.cnf". Finally, to test the map coloring problem, just run MapColoringSAT.py.
